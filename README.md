Using ML to determine patient specific tumor response using radiomic features: 
Extracting high-throughput quantitative tumor imaging features from CT, PET and PET-CT images is termed as radiomics. 
We wish touse ML to determine the probability of recurrence and survival rate as well as to determine the probability of recurrence and survival rate as well as to determine the response.
